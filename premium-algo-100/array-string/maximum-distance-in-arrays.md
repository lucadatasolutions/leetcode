# Maximum Distance in Arrays - Medium

Problem: You are given m arrays, where each array is sorted in **ascending order**.

You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and caluclate the distance. The distance between two integers a and b is their absolute difference |a - b|
