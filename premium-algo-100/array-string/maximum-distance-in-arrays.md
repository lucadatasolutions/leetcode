# Maximum Distance in Arrays - Medium

Problem: You are given m arrays, where each array is sorted in **ascending order**.

You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and caluclate the distance. The distance between two integers a and b is their absolute difference |a - b|.

Retrurn the ***maxiumum distance***. 

Example 1:  
  Input: arrays = [[1,2,3], [4,5], [1,2,3]]  <br />
  Output: 4 <br />
  Explantation: One way to reach the maxiumum distance 4 is to pick 1 in the first or third array and pick 5 in the second array.
